#include <stdio.h> // include the standard input/output library. gives us access to the terminal. similar to require in MEAN

int main(void)
{
// C function. void means no parameters. in C you have to return something. you must tell what you are returning this function is going to return an integer
// everything but variable declarations must be inside a function. this main function needs to be here in C.
    printf("Hello World!\n"); // printf is the console.log of C. need \n to run it on a new line
